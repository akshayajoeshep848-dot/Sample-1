    <!-- callback:it is a regular function passed as an argument to another function,which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some 
     kind of routine or action.callbacks are fundamental to asynchronous programming in js,allowing coding to continue running while waiting for
     operations like i/o ,timers,or network requests to complete.
     understanding callback:
     a callback function is simply function that it is called as after another function has finished executing.this pattern is especially useful for
     when dealing with operations like that take an unknown amount of time,such as reading files,making HTTP requests,or quering databases.-->



    <!-- callback function has 2 functions
      they are main function and callback function
      main function is called as higher order function. -->
