    <p>A promise is an object representing the eventual completion ( or failure) of an ansychronous operation and its
        resulting value.
        =====> This promise object allows you to register callbacks ("using methods like .then()" and .catch() that will
        be executed once the operation completes successfullay or fails)

        stastes of promise:
        (1)pending=====>operation not yet completed
        (2)fullfilled or Resloved ===> operatin completed successfully
        (3)Rejected ===> operation failed
        ***once a promise is "settled"..its state cannot change
