    <h1>ORDER</h1>
    <pre>The order property controls the order in flex items appear within the flex container by default items are laid out in their source order(as they appear in the HTML)
 .Accept an integer value(+ve, -ve or zero)
 .Default value zero(0)
 .Items with lower order values appear first. Items with same order value are laid out in the source order
 .This property allows you to change the visual order without altering the HTML structure, Which can be useful
   for responsiveness or capability consideration(Though be mindful that order still matters for things like tab navigation)</pre>

    <h1>CSS FLEX_BASIS</h1>
    <div class="parent">
        <div class="child child-1">child-1</div>
        <div class="child child-2">child-2</div>
        <div class="child child-3">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</div>
    </div>
    <br><br><br>
    <pre>
    Flex-basis:- It defines the default size of a flex items along the main axis before any remaining space distributed according to flex-grow or flex shrink.
	.Accept a length unit(px,%, em, etc.,), or the keywords auto or content
	.Default value is auto. If auto, the items main size property (width or height) is used. If that is also auto , it sized based on content.
    .If set to specific length, that becomes its intial main size.
	.The content keyword sizes items on its content size.
	.If fle-basis is set to a value other than auto, it genrally overrides the item width or height property for the purpose of flex layout calculation.</pre>

    <div>
        <h2>Flex-grow</h2>
        <p>
            Felx-grow property defines the ability of a flex items to grow if necessary. It specifies what proportion of
            the remaining space in the flex container should be distributed to them.
        <ul>
            <li>accept a unitless non-negative numbers(eg, 0, 1, 2)</li>
            <li>Default value is 0.(Meaning the item will not grow to full available soace).</li>
            <li>If all items have flex-grow:1 ,the remaining space is distributed equally among them.</li>
            <li>If one item has flex-grow: 2and others have flex-grow:1; The items with flex grow 2 will take up twice
                as
                much of the available space as the others.</li>
        </ul>

        This property is applied after the items have been sized according to flex-basis.It only has an effect if
        there is +ve free space in flex container.</p>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div>
        <h2>Flex shrink</h2>
        <p>Flex property defines the ability of a flex item to shrink if necessary
        <ul>
            <li>Accept a unitless non-negative number.</li>
            <li>Default value is 1.</li>
            <li>A value of 0 means the item will not shrink,</li>
            <li>.if one item has flex-shrink: 2, and others have flex-shrink:1, the item with flex-shrik: 2, will shrink
                twicw as much the others when space is insufficient. The amount an item shrink is also proportional to
                its flex-basis </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
