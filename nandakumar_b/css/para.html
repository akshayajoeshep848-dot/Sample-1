    <h1>Indian Premiur League</h1>
    <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20">Twenty20</a>
        (T20) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket">cricket</a> league in India, organised by the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India">Board
            of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)</a> .[1] Founded in 2007, it features ten city-based <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports_league_organization">franchise</a>
        teams.[2] The
        IPL is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_attendance_figures#Sports_leagues"> most
            popular</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_professional_sports_leagues_by_revenue">
            richest cricket league, and the second-richest sports league in the world</a>.
        It is
        held annually between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the Future Tours Programme of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council">International Cricket Council</a>,
        resulting in fewer international tours occurring during the seasons.[3] It is
        also the most viewed Indian sports event, per the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_Audience_Research_Council">Broadcast Audience Research
            Council</a> .
    </p>
    <p>In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to broadcast live on <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"> YouTube</a>.[6][7] In 2014, it ranked sixth in
        attendance among all sports leagues.[8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_in_India#Major_sporting_leagues_or_competitions">Indian sports
            leagues</a> have
        been established.[a][11][12] The IPL is the second-richest sports league in the world by per-match value, after
        the National Football League.[13] In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next four seasons for US$6.4
        billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,[14] which meant that each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million.[15] As of
        2025, there have been 18 seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the Royal Challengers Bengaluru,
        who won the 2025 season after defeating the Punjab Kings in the final.</p>
