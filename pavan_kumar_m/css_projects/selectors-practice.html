    <p><strong>Artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>  is the capability of <a href="">computational systems</a> to perform tasks typically associated
        with <a href="">human intelligence,</a> such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a
        <a href="">field of research</a> in <a href="">computer science</a> that develops and studies methods and <a href="">software</a> that enable machines to
        <a href="">perceive their environment</a> and use <a href="">learning</a> and <a href="">intelligence</a> to take actions that maximize their chances of
        achieving defined goals.[1]</p>
    <p>
        High-profile <a href="">applications of AI</a> include advanced <a href="">web search engines</a> (e.g., <a href="">Google Search</a>); <a href="">recommendation
        systems</a> (used by <a href="">YouTube, Amazon</a>, and <a href="">Netflix</a>); <a href="">virtual assistants</a> (e.g., <a href="">Google Assistant</a>, <a href="">Siri</a>, and <a href="">Alexa</a>);
        <a href="">autonomous vehicles</a> (e.g., <a href="">Waymo</a>); <a href="">generative</a> and <a href="">creative</a> tools (e.g., <a href="">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="">AI art</a>); and <a href="">superhuman</a> play
        and analysis in <a href="">strategy games</a> (e.g., <a href="">chess</a> and <a href="">Go</a>). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A
        lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once
        something becomes useful enough and common enough it's <a href=""></a>
