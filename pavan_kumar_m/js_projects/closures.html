    <h1>Closures</h1>
    <p>
      A closure is created when a function remembers the variables from its
      outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In simple terms: A closure is when an inner function has access to the
      outer functionâ€™s variables, even after the outer function is done running.
    </p>

    <script>
        function outerFunction(){
            let counter=0
            function InnerFunction(){
                counter++
                console.log(counter)
            }
            return InnerFunction;
        }
        let mycounter=outerFunction()
        mycounter()
        // outerFunction()()



        
    </script>
