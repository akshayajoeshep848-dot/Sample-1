    <p>The <b> Indian Premier League (IPL) </b> is a professional<span> Twenty20 </span> (T20) <span> cricket </span>
        league in India, organised by the <span> Board of Control for Cricket in India </span> (BCCI).[1] Founded in
        2007, it features ten city-based <span> franchise </span> teams.[2] The IPL is the <span> most popular</span>
        and <span>richest cricket league, and the second-richest sports league in the world. </span> It is held annually
        between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the <span> Future Tours Programme</span> of the <span>
        International Cricket Council, </span> resulting in fewer international tours occurring during the seasons.[3] It is
        also the most viewed Indian sports event, per the <span> Broadcast Audience Research Council.[4][5]</span></p>

    <p>In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to broadcast live on <span> YouTube.[6][7]</span> In 2014, it ranked sixth in
        attendance among all sports leagues.[8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other <span> Indian sports leagues </span> have
        been established.[a][11][12] The IPL is the second-richest sports league in the world by per-match value, after
        the <span> National Football League.[13]</span>  In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next four seasons for US$6.4
        billion to <span> Viacom18 </span> and <span> Star Sports,[14] </span> which meant that each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million.[15] As of
        2025, there have been 18 seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the <span> Royal Challengers Bengaluru,</span>
        who won the <span> 2025 season </span> after defeating the <span> Punjab Kings </span> in the <span> final.</span></p>
