<p>Amateur<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_(disambiguation)">sports <a>are  in which participants engage largely or entirely without remuneration.
     The distinction is made between amateur sporting participants and professional sporting participants,
      who are paid for the time they spend competing and training. In the majority of sports which feature professional players,
       the professionals will participate at a higher standard of play than amateur competitors, as they can train full-time without the stress of having another job. 
       The majority of worldwide sporting participants are amateurs.
       Cricket is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-and-ball_games">Bat-and-ball games</a> game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these swaps. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.
