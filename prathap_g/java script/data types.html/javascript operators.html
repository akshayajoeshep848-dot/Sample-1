JavaScript Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values and variables. They are essential for building expressions and manipulating data. Here's a concise overview of the main types of operators in JavaScript:

1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for mathematical calculations:

+ (Addition): 5 + 3 → 8
- (Subtraction): 5 - 3 → 2
* (Multiplication): 5 * 3 → 15
/ (Division): 5 / 3 → 1.666...
% (Modulus): 5 % 3 → 2
** (Exponentiation): 5 ** 3 → 125


2. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables:

= (Assign): x = 5
+= (Add and assign): x += 3 → x = x + 3
-= (Subtract and assign): x -= 3
*= (Multiply and assign): x *= 3
/= (Divide and assign): x /= 3


3. Comparison Operators
Used to compare values:

== (Equal to): 5 == '5' → true
=== (Strict equal): 5 === '5' → false
!= (Not equal): 5 != '5' → false
!== (Strict not equal): 5 !== '5' → true
> (Greater than): 5 > 3 → true
< (Less than): 5 < 3 → false
>= (Greater than or equal to): 5 >= 3
<= (Less than or equal to): 5 <= 3


4. Logical Operators
Used for logical operations:

&& (AND): true && false → false
|| (OR): true || false → true
! (NOT): !true → false


5. String Operators
Used to manipulate strings:

+ (Concatenation): 'Hello' + ' World' → 'Hello World'
+= (Concatenate and assign): str += ' World'


6. Ternary Operator
A shorthand for if-else:

condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false

Example: 5 > 3 ? 'Yes' : 'No' → 'Yes'




7. Bitwise Operators
Operate on binary representations:

& (AND), | (OR), ^ (XOR), ~ (NOT), << (Left shift), >> (Right shift)


8. Other Operators

Typeof: typeof 42 → 'number'
Delete: delete obj.property
In: 'key' in obj
Instanceof: obj instanceof Class


These operators are the building blocks of JavaScript expressions, enabling you to perform a wide range of operations efficiently.
