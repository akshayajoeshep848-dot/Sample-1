    <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between <a href="#"> two teams</a> of eleven players on a <a href="#">field</a>, at the centre of which is
         a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a <a href="#"> wicket</a> at each end, each comprising two <a href="#"> bails </a>(small sticks) balanced on <a href="#">three stumps</a>. 
        <a href="#"> Two players</a> from the batting team, the striker and <a href="#">nonstriker</a>, stand in front of either wicket <a href="#">holding bats</a>, while one player 
         from the <a href="#">fielding team</a>, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the <a href="#">striker's</a> wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's
          goal is to hit <a href="#"> bowled ball</a> with the bat and then switch places with the <a href="#">nonstriker</a>, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these swaps. Runs 
        are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.</p>
