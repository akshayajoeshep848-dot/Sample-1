/*Scoping:
        Scope = where a variable is available in code. (or)scope in JavaScript is the area where a variable is defined and can be accessed.

        Global scope → everywhere.

        Function scope → inside the function only.

        Block scope (let, const) → inside { } only.

        Lexical scope → inner functions can access outer variables.*/
