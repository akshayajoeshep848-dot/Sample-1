        Set on the fictional continents of <a href="">Westeros</a> and <a href="Essos"></a> , <a href="">Game of
            Thrones</a> has a large ensemble cast and follows
        several story arcs throughout the course of the show. The first major arc concerns the <a href="">Iron
            Throne</a> of the <a href="">Seven
            Kingdoms</a> of Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families either vying to claim
        the
        throne or fighting for independence from whoever sits on it. The second major arc focuses on the last descendant
        of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting to return and reclaim the
        throne. The third follows the Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats from beyond
        the Seven Kingdoms' northern border.
