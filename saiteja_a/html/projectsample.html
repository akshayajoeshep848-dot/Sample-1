	<h1>Geography</h1>
	<p>Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Konaseema district is situated in the delta of the Godavari River. The land in this region is considered highly fertile, and its economy is primarily based on agriculture,[3] especially with a focus on rice and coconut cultivation.[4] Mangrove forests are present in the northeast of the district.[5] Apart from the Ramachandrapuram revenue division, the district lies between the two branches of the Godavari River. The Godavari divides into two components, namely Gautami and Vasishtha,[6] forming an island which is called Konaseema.[7]</p>
	<p>This district is surrounded to the north by East Godavari district, south by the Bay of Bengal, east by Kakinada district and west by West Godavari district.[8]</p>

	<h1>History</h1>
	<p>On 26 January 2022 the Andhra Pradesh Cabinet made a significant decision to create 13 new districts, and among them, the proposal for the Konaseema district was approved.[9][10] On 4 April 2022 the chief minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy virtually inaugurated all 13 new districts, officially establishing Konaseema district.[11][12] However, on 18 May 2022, the government initiated discussions about renaming Konaseema district in honour of B. R. Ambedkar, leading to violent protests on 24 May 2022, during which protesters set ablaze the home of transport minister Pinipe Viswarup.[13][14]</p>
	<p>Subsequently, on 24 June 2022, the Andhra Pradesh Cabinet endorsed the gazette notification issued on May 18, officially approving the renaming of the district.[15][16][17] Finally, on 2 August 2022, Konaseema district was officially renamed to Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Konaseema district. The change took effect on that date, as announced in the gazette notification by the Governor of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>The notification stated:</p>
<ul>
	<ol>the Governor of Andhra Pradesh, in the interests of public, after having published proposals in that regard as required under sub-section (5) of Section 3 of the Andhra Pradesh Districts (formation) Act, 1974 (Act No.7 of 1974), and having taken into consideration the objections and suggestions received thereon all persons in the areas concerned and likely to be affected thereby, do hereby notify to change the existing name of the Konaseema district as Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Konaseema district[18]</ol>
