   why is dom important
   The dom is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web page.without it js would
   have no way to understand or modify the structure and conent of an html document.
   
   Dynamic content:
        js can add,remove,or change html element and their content after 
        the page has loaded
   user interaction: 
        js can react to user actions(click,mouse movements)
   styling changes:
        js can manupulate css styles of elemnts,chenge their appearence dynimically
   data display:
        js can fetch data from servers and use the dom to display this data on
        the page without needing a full page reload
