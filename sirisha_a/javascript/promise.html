    <!-- a promise is an obj representing eventual ccmpletion(or failure)of an asynchronus operation

    this promise obj allows you to register callback(using methods like .then() and .catch() that will be executed once 
    the operation completes successfully or fails)

    promise states
    1.pending :the initial state ,the operation has not yet completed
    2.fulfilled(or resolved):the operation completed sucessfully,and the promise has resulting value
    3.Rejected:the operation failed,and the promise has a reason for the failure

    unsettled state means 1 
    settled states are 2&3
    once a promise is setted its state cannot be changed again


    creating 
    1.resolve(value)
    2.reject(reason) -->
